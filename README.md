# TwitchPredictions

This repo is an example of how to use twitch predictions
As the API is currently in beta along with the library (TwitchLib) I'm using
Its a bit limited in functionality.

The main point of this repo is a list of premade predictions you can click via a list to make running duplicate predictions over and over.
